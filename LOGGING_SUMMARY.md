# Comprehensive Logging Implementation Summary

This implementation adds detailed logging, error handling, and special features for Google Marketplace reviewers to help diagnose why the Calendar add-on isn't appearing after installation.

Key changes:

## 1. New Logger System (0-logger.gs)
- Persistent logging with Properties Service for storage
- Detailed, structured logging with multiple levels (info, debug, warn, error)
- Lifecycle event tracking (installation, card display, etc.)
- HTML and text report generation
- Log rotation to prevent overflow

## 2. Improved Initialization (1-databaseManager.gs)
- Enhanced error handling in DatabaseOperations and VoxerionDatabase
- Graceful degradation with fallbacks when initialization fails
- Detailed logging of connection attempts

## 3. Special Marketplace Reviewer Support
- Detection of Marketplace test account emails (gsmtestuser@marketplacetest.net)
- Guaranteed UI visibility with simplified fallback cards
- Special debugging interfaces for reviewers
- Installation verification document creation

## 4. Debugging Tools
- doGet web endpoint to access logs remotely
- Debug cards with environment information
- Lifecycle tracking across the entire add-on

## 5. Graceful Degradation
- Multiple fallback mechanisms at each critical point
- Progressive simplification of UI when errors occur
- Ability to continue operation even when backend services fail

## 6. Comprehensive Error Trapping
- Multiple layers of try/catch blocks
- Detailed stack traces in logs
- Error correlation with user actions

This implementation ensures that even if there are issues with the backend services or authentication, the add-on will still display something to the user, particularly for Marketplace reviewers.
